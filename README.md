Download and install Python 2.7 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ if not already installed on your machine.
Using the terminal, navigate to the project directory where you will find the files for this project:
	movie.py -  This module corresponds to the movie class that holds information about the movie object
	CreateMovies.py - This module is where various instances of the movie object are actually created and instantiated.
			              All information pertaining to the movie object is passed on in this module.
	fresh_tomatoes.py- This module takes the list of movies passed on in CreateMovies.py and generates a HTML file.
Once in the project directory, type "CreateMovies.py" if on a Windows machine and "python CreateMovies.py" if on a Mac/Linux machine.
This will generate a html file called fresh_tomatoes.html in the working directory.
Right click on fresh_tomatoes.html file and open it in a browser of your choice. This will display the movies along with their trailers.
